Here a small package <i>dam</i> (dynamics of atoms in materials) is available. The dam package contains codes to train spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) and perform molecular dynamics simulations. Package dam was developed using both Python and Linux commands. Therefore, it should be used on Linux machine.  

There is example folder inside dam directory, showing how to use different classes and functions of the package for different purpose.
